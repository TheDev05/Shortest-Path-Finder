# Shortest Path Finder

## Description
The Shortest Path Finder is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This application provides a user-friendly interface for finding the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Grid:** Utilizing HTML and CSS, the application displays an interactive grid where users can visualize the graph-like structure.
- **Obstacle Placement:** Users can place obstacles on the grid to represent blocked paths, enhancing the realism of pathfinding scenarios.
- **BFS Algorithm:** Implemented in JavaScript, the BFS algorithm efficiently searches the grid for the shortest path between the designated start and end points.
- **Visualization of Path:** Upon completion of the BFS algorithm, the shortest path is visually highlighted on the grid, providing users with a clear representation of the optimal route.

## How it Works
1. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the application by clicking on grid cells to set the start and end points, as well as placing obstacles as needed.
2. **Pathfinding:** Upon initiating the pathfinding process, the BFS algorithm traverses the grid, systematically exploring adjacent nodes to determine the shortest path.
3. **Visualization:** As the BFS algorithm progresses, the grid is updated in real-time to reflect the explored nodes and the current path under evaluation.
4. **Optimal Path Display:** Once the BFS algorithm completes, the shortest path is highlighted on the grid, providing users with a clear visual representation of the optimal route.

## Benefits
- **Educational Tool:** The Shortest Path Finder serves as an educational tool for understanding graph algorithms, particularly BFS, in a practical context.
- **Problem-Solving Aid:** Users can utilize the application to solve real-world pathfinding problems, such as finding the shortest route in a maze or navigating obstacles.
